# twitch-channelpoints_clicker
Works using [PyAutoGui](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
Depends on [opencv](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/), which need to be linked to the project for proper confidence realisation.


## Todo list  
- [x] initial commit  
- [ ] add click to twitch favicon before checking every 2 minutes (for better background work)
